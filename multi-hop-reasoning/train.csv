Selkirk, which is 10 miles (16\xa0km) south of Albany and the home of Selkirk Yard, a major CSX classification yard.', ' As a result, trains from Long Island and New York City (except for the borough of Staten Island which has a rail bridge to New Jersey) must travel 140 mi north to cross at Selkirk before continuing on their way.', ' Advocates claim that this detour and the inefficiencies that result force New York City to rely more heavily on relatively inefficient trucks than most parts of the United States, where freight trains are more common.', ' However, at least for traffic to and from the west, this route was touted for its efficiency as the ""Water Level Route"" by the New York Central Railroad because trains using it did not have to climb over the Appalachian Mountains, and
