"Very early this morning, Elise left home in a cab headed for the hospital. Fortunately, the roads were clear, and the cab company only charged her a base price of $3, and $4 for every mile she traveled. If Elise paid a total of $23, how far is the hospital from her house?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the total cost and the base price
Elise paid a total of $23 and the base price is $3.

Step 2: Subtract the base price from the total cost to find the cost of the miles traveled
$23 - $3 = $20

Step 3: Divide the cost of the miles traveled by the cost per mile to find the total miles traveled
$20 / $4 per mile = 5 miles

Therefore, the hospital is 5 miles from Elise's house.

"Josh is saving up for a box of cookies. To raise the money, he is going to make bracelets and sell them. It costs $1 for supplies for each bracelet and he sells each one for $1.5. If he makes 12 bracelets and after buying the cookies still has $3, how much did the box of cookies cost?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh makes 12 bracelets and sells each one for $1.5. To find the total amount of money he earns from selling the bracelets, we multiply the number of bracelets by the selling price:
12 bracelets * $1.5/bracelet = $18

2. It costs $1 for supplies for each bracelet, so the total cost of making 12 bracelets is:
12 bracelets * $1/bracelet = $12

3. Josh earns $18 from selling the bracelets and spends $12 on supplies, so his profit is:
$18 - $12 = $6

4. After buying the cookies, Josh still has $3. This means that the cost of the cookies is the difference between his profit and the amount he has left:
$6 - $3 = $3

"Colin can skip at six times the speed that Brandon can.  Brandon can skip at one-third the speed that Tony can.  And Tony can skip at twice the speed that Bruce can.  At what speed, in miles per hour, can Colin skip if Bruce skips at 1 mile per hour?","To solve this problem, we need to find the skipping speed of Colin in terms of Bruce's speed.

1. Tony's speed is twice Bruce's speed: 
   Tony's speed = 2 * Bruce's speed
   Tony's speed = 2 * 1 mile/hour (since Bruce's speed is 1 mile/hour)
   Tony's speed = 2 miles/hour

2. Brandon's speed is one-third Tony's speed:
   Brandon's speed = (1/3) * Tony's speed
   Brandon's speed = (1/3) * 2 miles/hour
   Brandon's speed = (2/3) miles/hour

3. Colin's speed is six times Brandon's speed:
   Colin's speed = 6 * Brandon's speed
   Colin's speed = 6 * (2/3) miles/hour
   Colin's speed = (6 * 2) / 3 miles/hour
   Colin's speed = 12/3 miles/hour
   Colin's speed = 4 miles/hour

"Janet, a third grade teacher, is picking up the sack lunch order from a local deli for the field trip she is taking her class on. There are 35 children in her class, 5 volunteer chaperones, and herself. She she also ordered three additional sack lunches, just in case there was a problem. Each sack lunch costs $7. How much do all the lunches cost in total?","To find the total cost of all the lunches, we need to calculate the total number of lunches ordered.

There are 35 children in her class, 5 volunteer chaperones, and herself, so the total number of people for whom she initially ordered lunches is 35 + 5 + 1 = 41.

She also ordered three additional sack lunches, just in case, so the total number of lunches is 41 + 3 = 44.

Each sack lunch costs $7, so the total cost of all the lunches is 44 x $7 = $308.

However, she also needs to include herself and the 5 chaperones as separate counts in the total number of people for whom she ordered lunches. But the problem statement does not ask to include the 3 additional sacks as additional people.

Therefore, the total cost of all the lunches is $308.

"At 30, Anika is 4/3 the age of Maddie. What would be their average age in 15 years?","Step 1: In 15 years, Anika will be 30 + 15 = 45 years old.

Step 2: At 30, Anika is 4/3 the age of Maddie. 
Let's find Maddie's current age. 
Anika's age = 4/3 * Maddie's age 
30 = 4/3 * Maddie's age 
Multiplying both sides by 3/4: 
30 * 3/4 = Maddie's age 
Maddie's age = 22.5 

Step 3: In 15 years, Maddie will be 22.5 + 15 = 37.5 years old.

Step 4: In 15 years, Anika's age will be 45 and Maddie's age will be 37.5.

Step 5: To find the average age in 15 years, add Anika's and Maddie's age and then divide by 2. 
Average age = (Anika's age + Maddie's age) / 2 
Average age = (45 + 37.5) / 2 
Average age = 82.5 / 2 
Average age = 41.25
